# üöÄ Project Overview  
The project focuses on analyzing product return risks in e-commerce using machine learning and data visualization tools. It includes:  
* Data Generation: Simulates product-related data (e.g., categories, brands, prices, ratings) for analysis.  
* Model Development: Builds a predictive model using XGBoost to classify whether a product has a high return risk.  
* Dashboard Creation: Implements an interactive Streamlit dashboard for data exploration, model predictions, and insights.  
* Document Q&A Assistant: Integrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot to answer user queries based on uploaded documents.  

# üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Execution Instructions  

## *1. Environment Setup*  
Install required Python libraries:  
* pandas  
* numpy  
* matplotlib  
* seaborn  
* scikit-learn  
* xgboost  
* streamlit  
* imblearn  
* plotly  
* fitz (PyMuPDF)  
* pinecone-client  
* sentence-transformers  
* transformers  

Configure Pinecone API key for document indexing.

## *2. Execution Steps*  
* Run the script to generate synthetic product data using the `data_gen` function.  
* Train the XGBoost model using the `model_train` function, including preprocessing (outlier treatment, label encoding, scaling, and SMOTE-Tomek).  
* Save the trained model using `pickle` for future use.  
* Launch the Streamlit dashboard to interact with the data:  
  * Explore product return risk data in tabular format or via visualizations.  
  * Predict return risk for individual products or bulk datasets.  
  * Use the Q&A assistant to query uploaded documents.  

# üì± Streamlit Dashboard Features  
* Tabs for:  
  * Product_Return_Table (Data Exploration)  
  * Dashboard (Visual Analytics)  
  * Model_Prediction (Return Risk Prediction)  
  * Q&A (Document-Based Assistant)  
* Options to export datasets and predictions as CSV files  

# üß† Model and Tool Explanation
